            A pivot table helps you organize and summarize your data. It's like sorting your data into neat boxes.

            **Example:** If you have race results data with 100 races:

            - You could group by **Jockey** to see how many races each jockey won
            - You could group by **Year** to count races in each year
            - You could group by **Track** to find the average race time at each location

            ### How to use this tool:

            1. Pick the column you want to group by (like "Jockey" or "Year")
            2. Pick what values you want to see (like "Race Time" or "Position")

            Prediction looks at patterns in your data to make educated guesses about missing values.

            - You could predict a horse's **finish time** based on its past performance
            - You could guess the **position** a horse might finish based on other factors
            - You could predict if a horse will **win or lose** based on track conditions

            ### Two Main Types of Prediction:

            **Regression** - Predicts a number (like finish time, speed, or points)

            **Classification** - Predicts a category (like win/lose, 1st/2nd/3rd place)

            and tries to predict what will happen in the future.

            **For example:**
            - If you have **race times** from 2023-2025, you could predict race times for 2026
            - If you have **monthly results** for several years, you can see seasonal patterns
            - If you have **daily performance data**, you can spot trends over time

            ### How it Works:

            1. You select a date/time column from your data
            2. You choose what value you want to predict
            3. The app finds patterns in your past data
            4. The app makes predictions about future values

            It's perfect for racing data where you want to see if performance is improving or declining over time!

            ### What AI Analysis Does

            The AI (artificial intelligence) looks at your data and:

            1. **Finds patterns** you might not notice on your own
            2. **Explains trends** in simple language
            3. **Suggests insights** that could be helpful
            4. **Answers questions** about your data

            ### Example Use Cases:

            - **Racing data analysis**: Find which factors most affect race outcomes
            - **Seasonal patterns**: Discover if certain months have better results
            - **Performance drivers**: Identify what makes the biggest difference in results
            - **Story creation**: Generate an easy-to-understand story about your data

            ### How to Use It:

            1. Select what you want the AI to analyze
            2. Ask specific questions if you have them
            3. Review the insights it discovers
